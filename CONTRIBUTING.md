# Contributing to Moja Global's Land Sector Data Analysis

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Moja Global's Land Sector Data Analysis project. Your contributions help us analyze and utilize valuable open-source datasets for the betterment of our global community. This guide will walk you through the process of contributing to our project.

## 1. Getting Started

### 1.1 The Land Sector Dataset

The Moja Global's Land Sector Dataset is a collection of publicly available Open source datasets. You have the freedom to choose any dataset from this collection to work on for your analysis. Please note that each dataset comes with its own content and licensing terms. Make sure to read and adhere to the licensing terms of the dataset you select before proceeding with your analysis.

If you have another dataset in mind that aligns with Moja Global's mission, we encourage you to share the details of this dataset with us by reaching out to [info@moja.global](mailto:info@moja.global).

### 1.2 Data Analysis Software and Notebooks

We recommend using data analysis software and notebooks for your work. Notebooks are documents that combine code and rich text elements to make your analysis both human-readable and executable. Select software that supports geospatial analysis as this is aligned with Moja Global's objectives.

We encourage open-source practices, so please use tools and software that allow you to share your code and results effectively. We recommend using a notebook for your analysis, and you can use platforms like Google Colab.
