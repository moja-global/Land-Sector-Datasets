# Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Mapping Prototype

This prototype provides a comprehensive overview of the mapping process, encompassing the dataset specifics, attributes under scrutiny, the reasoning behind the mapping, and the resultant findings. Within this document, we will employ datasets from diverse land sectors to delineate prototype mappings for the SDGs.

In this prototype, the focus will be on these three SDGs below in relation to the chosen Datasets (Global Biodiversity Hotspot dataset, World Protected Areas dataset, and Climate dataset);
### - Global Biodiversity Hotspot Dataset - SDG 15 (Life on Land) and SDG 14 (Life Below Water)
#### Dataset Attributes: 
The dataset utilized in this analysis has been responsibly provided by Conservation International (CI), a globally recognized environmental organization committed to safeguarding and preserving natural habitats and biodiversity on a global scale.

#### Mapping Explanation:
The datasets included here hold particular relevance to two key Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); the first is SDG 15 - Life on Land: This dataset contributes to SDG 15, which focuses on protecting and restoring life on land, including terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity. The information contained within these datasets aids in the assessment and preservation of critical terrestrial habitats, which is essential for achieving SDG 15's objectives. The second is SDG 14 - Life Below Water: While the dataset primarily addresses terrestrial ecoregions, it indirectly impacts SDG 14 as well. The health of terrestrial ecosystems influences the quality and sustainability of adjacent marine environments, highlighting the interconnectedness of terrestrial and aquatic life. Protecting land-based habitats can have positive ripple effects on life below water, making it relevant to SDG 14.

By mapping and analyzing the world's biodiversity hotspots and ecoregions, these datasets play a vital role in advancing these Sustainable Development Goals and promoting global biodiversity conservation and sustainability efforts.

### - World Terrestrial Eco Regions Dataset - SDG 15 (Life on Land) and SDG 13 (Climate Actions)
#### Dataset Attributes:
The dataset used in this analysis has been obtained from the World Wide Fund (WWF) database, and it pertains to the mapping of Terrestrial Eco Regions worldwide.

#### Mapping Explanation:
Both the Neotropic and Nearctic regions are home to a wide range of terrestrial ecosystems and species. SDG 15 focuses on protecting, restoring, and promoting sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity. The conservation efforts in these regions contribute significantly to this goal. Also, Climate action (SDG 13) is relevant as these regions play a role in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Preservation of forests and other ecosystems in these regions can help sequester carbon and contribute to climate resilience.

### - Climate Dataset - SDG 13 (Climate Action) 
#### Dataset Attributes:
The values in this dataset attribute represent the different climate zones. They are defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change. The values to be considered include; 
1. Warm Temperate Moist
2. Warm Temperate Dry
3. Cool Temperate Moist
4. Cool Temperate Dry
5. Polar Moist
6. Polar Dry
7. Boreal Moist
8. Boreal Dry
9. Tropical Montane
    
#### Mapping Explanation:
The dataset has been correlated with the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) focused on Climate Action (SDG 13). This particular SDG is dedicated to addressing and mitigating the impact of climate change on the planet and its ecosystems. It emphasizes the need for immediate and concerted efforts to combat climate change and its detrimental effects on life
