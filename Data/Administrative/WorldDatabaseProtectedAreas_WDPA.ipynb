    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) is the most comprehensive global database of marine and terrestrial protected areas. It is a joint project between UN Environment Programme and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and is managed by UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), in collaboration with governments, non-governmental organisations, academia and industry.The WDPA is updated on a monthly basis, and can be downloaded using the button in the top right of this page.<br>\n",

    "As the data collates many different reserve types from many different sources, there are a range of topological issues including significant duplication and overlapping of reserve areas. There are over 150,000 overlapping polygons in the National cateogry alone. To simplify this dataset for use in FLINT, only National reserves are shown, excluding Marine, Regional and International reserve areas.\n",

    "The WDPA is a joint project between UN Environment Programme and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The compilation and management of the WDPA is carried out by UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), in collaboration with governments, non-governmental organisations, academia and industry. There are monthly updates of the data which are made available online through the ProtectedPlanet website where the data is both viewable and downloadable.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Data and information on the world's protected areas compiled in the WDPA are used for reporting to the Convention on Biological Diversity on progress towards reaching the Aichi Biodiversity Targets (particularly Target 11), to the UN to track progress towards the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, to some of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) core indicators, and other international assessments and reports including the Global Biodiversity Outlook, as well as for the publication of the United Nations List of Protected Areas. Every two years, UNEP-WCMC releases the Protected Planet Report on the status of the world's protected areas and recommendations on how to meet international goals and targets.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on the WDPA please read through the [User Manual](http://wcmc.io/WDPA_Manual).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "There are significant topological issues in this dataset including significant duplication and overlapping of reserve area types (National, International, Regional and Marine). Reserve areas vary from stratigh eco protection to sustainable game management and indigenous lands. To simplify this dataset for use in FLINT, only National reserves are included, excluding Marine, Regional and International reserve areas. Reserves are then split into IUCN Cateogory. Processing time is lengthy as the dataset is 200,000+ attributes. Processing this layer to suit your individual project needs is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaps and overlaps are evident and can be fixed with code below.  Please note, only gaps smaller than 0.1ha will be fixed as gaps larger than this could be valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing\n",
    "Query National Reserves only and non-marine. Repair geometry, fix topologial error (remove overlaps), convert to geojson, EPSG:4326 (WGS84), remove/disable Z values."
