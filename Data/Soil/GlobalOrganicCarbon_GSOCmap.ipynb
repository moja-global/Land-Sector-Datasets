    "## Title: Global Organic Carbon GSOCmap VERSION 1.5.0\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "GSOCmap is the first global soil organic carbon map ever produced through a consultative and participatory process involving member countries, which makes this map totally new and unique. In fact, the map was prepared by member countries, under the guidance of the Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils and the Global Soil Partnership Secretariat. Values are SOC tonnes ha-1<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Countries agreed on the methodology to produce the map and were trained on modern tools and methodologies to develop national maps. The Global Soil Partnership then gathered all national maps to produce the final product, ensuring a thorough harmonization process.<br>\n",
