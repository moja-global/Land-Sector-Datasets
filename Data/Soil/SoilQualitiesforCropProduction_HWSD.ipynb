    "## Title: Soil Qualities for Crop Production HWSD Supplement\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "On the basis of soil parameters provided by HWSD seven key soil qualities important for crop production have been derived, namely: nutrient availability, nutrient retention capacity, rooting conditions, oxygen availability to roots, excess salts, toxicities, and workability. Soil qualities are related to the agricultural use of the soil and more specifically to specific crop requirements and tolerances. For the illustration of soil qualities, maize was selected as reference crop because of its global importance and wide geographical distribution.\n",

    "Classes are qualitative not quantitative. Only classes 1 to 4 are corresponding to an assessment of soil limitations for plant growth. Class 1 is generally rated between 80 and 100% of the growth potential, class 2 between 60 and 80%, class 3 between 40 and 60%, and class 4 less than 40%.\n",
