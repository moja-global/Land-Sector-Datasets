    "## Title: Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "The HWSD is a 30 arc-second raster database with over 16000 different soil mapping units that combines existing regional and national updates of soil information worldwide (SOTER, ESD, Soil Map of China, WISE) with the information contained within the 1:5 000 000 scale FAO-UNESCO Soil Map of the World (FAO, 19711981).\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting raster database consists of 21600 rows and 43200 columns, which are linked to harmonized soil property data. The use of a standardized structure allows for the linkage of the attribute data with the raster map to display or query the composition in terms of soil units and the characterization of selected soil parameters (organic Carbon, pH, water storage capacity, soil depth, cation exchange capacity of the soil and the clay fraction, total exchangeable nutrients, lime and gypsum contents, sodium exchange percentage, salinity, textural class and granulometry).\n",

    "### FLINT\n",
    "This dataset has been checked/pre-processed and is suitable for use in FLINT. Please adhere to individual dataset licence conditions and citations. Processed data can be accessed here: [Land Sector Datasets](https://datasets.mojaglobal.workers.dev/) https://datasets.mojaglobal.workers.dev/<br>\n",

    "### Notes\n",
    "Each pixel value is related to the HWSD MU_GLOBAL code (Value 0 - 32050). The HWSD is composed of a GIS raster image file linked to an attribute database in Microsoft Access format. This code (Value) qualifies soil type, soil properties and chemistry. Value zero is water and equivalent to NoData. Two csv tables [dataTables](https://datasets.mojaglobal.workers.dev/0:/World_datasets/Soil/tiff/HarmonisedWorldSoilDatabase/) are provided summarising the data relationships between the database and spatial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing\n",
    "Dataset is re-processed (resampled) to the nearest 0.005 degrees resolution (extent 180.0 -90.0 180.0 90.0), warping the coordinate system from unknown to WGS84, building raster attribute table, exporting to tif (compressed). Use the below code to resample to different resolution by changing \"-r 0.005 0.005.\" Use the csv datatables or access database to join the Value Code to determine soil type code and soil chemistry and other properties."
