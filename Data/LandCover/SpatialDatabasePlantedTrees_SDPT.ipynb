    "## Title: Spatial Database of Planted Trees (SDPT)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "The Spatial Database of Planted Trees (SDPT) was compiled by Global Forest Watch using data obtained from national governments, non-governmental organizations and independent researchers. Data were compiled for 82 countries around the world, with most country maps originating from supervised classification or manual polygon delineation of Landsat, SPOT or RapidEye satellite imagery.\n",
    "\n",
    "The category of “planted trees” in the SDPT includes forest plantations of native or introduced species, established through deliberate human planting or seeding. Sometimes called “tree farms,” these forests infuse the global economy with a constant stream of lumber for construction, pulp for paper and fuelwood for energy. The data set also includes agricultural tree crops like oil palm plantations, avocado farms, apple orchards and even Christmas tree farms. The SDPT makes it possible to identify planted forests and tree crops as being separate from natural forests and enables changes in these planted areas to be monitored independently from changes in global natural forest cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SDPT contains 173 million hectares of planted forest and 50 million hectares of agricultural trees, or approximately 82% of the world’s total planted forest area in 2015 (FAO 2015). The SDPT was compiled through a procedure that included cleaning and processing each individual data set before creating a harmonized attribute table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Available as single country datasets, as well as a compiled global version (excluding countries with no data notably Canada, Russia and some African countries).\n",
    "\n",
    "### FLINT\n",
    "This dataset has been pre-processed/checked and is suitable for use in FLINT. Please adhere to individual dataset licence conditions and citations. Processed data can be accessed here: https://datasets.mojaglobal.workers.dev/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Format\n",
    "<b>Extent: </b>Compiled country - global but excluding some countries<br>\n",
    "<b>Format</b>: polygon geoJSON .json<br>\n",
    "<b>Cordinate system:</b> EPSG:4326 (WGS84)<br>\n",
    "<b>Temporal Resolution: </b>multiple<br>\n",
    "<b>Size: 10GB+ (individual country file sizes smaller)</b>  \n",
    "\n",

    "https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=224e00192f6d408fa5147bbfc13b62dd\n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata states there is data available for 82 countries, however only 43 from the downloaded source are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "This dataset is a compilation of planted trees data from a variety of countries and sources. As a result, there are definitional and temporal inconsistencies within the database, as well as an absence of a uniform accuracy assessment and incomplete spatial coverage, notably in Canada, Russia and countries in Africa.\n",
    "\n",
    "File sizes are large due to detail and resoltion of the vectors. Processing time is lengthy and final vector json sizes large. Significant self intersection, significant gaps but overlaps are generally ok.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing\n",
    "Repair geometry, fix topologial error (remove overlaps and small gaps), convert to geojson, EPSG:4326 (WGS84), remove/disable Z values. The Sth Korea, USA, South Africa and India datasets are very large, detailed with many attributes and vertices, and are 1GB+ in json format. South Korea was so large (6GB) - it was split into three, simplified using the Douglas-Peucker algorithm with a 5m tolerance and stictched back together. It is not recommeded the large files are combined into a global dataset without simplification in GIS first (someone please let me know if you want this)."
