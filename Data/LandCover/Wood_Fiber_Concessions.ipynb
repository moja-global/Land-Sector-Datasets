    "## Title: Wood_Fiber_Concessions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "“Wood fiber concession” refers to an area allocated by a government or other body for establishment of fast-growing tree plantations for the production of timber and wood pulp for paper and paper products.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set displays wood fiber concessions as a single layer assembled by aggregating concession data for multiple countries. The data may come from government agencies, NGOs, or other organizations and varies by date and data sources. For more information on concession data for each country please visit the Open Data Portal.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This data was updated in September 2018 to update boundaries for APRIL.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are aware of concession data for additional countries, please email us here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### FLINT\n",
    "This dataset has been pre-processed/checked and is suitable for use in FLINT. Please adhere to individual dataset licence conditions and citations. Processed data can be accessed here: https://datasets.mojaglobal.workers.dev/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Format\n",
    "<b>Extent: </b>Indonesia, Republic of Congo, Malaysia<br>\n",
    "<b>Format</b>: Vector polyon geoJSON<br>\n",

    "### Notes\n",
    "Limitations of use: This layer is a compilation of concession data from various countries and sources. The quality of these data can vary depending on the source. This layer may not include all existing concessions in a country, and the location of certain concessions can be inaccurate.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Significant overlap, error in geometry (duplicate vertex and non-simple geometry), Indonesian data looks to have multiple resolutions of input data which has led to slither gaps and overlaps. All overlaps are fixed using the code below fixed (which will mean one polygon will win the area over another based on the longest edge shared), and small slithers less than 2ha are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing\n",
    "See below for arcpy code to fix geometry, gaps and overlaps. It is recommended that additional manual cleaning is undertaken."
