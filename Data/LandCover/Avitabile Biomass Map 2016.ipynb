    "An integrated pan-tropical map of aboveground biomass in woody vegetation using multiple reference datasets.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a novel data fusion approach (see below), we have integrated two existing large-scale biomass maps (Saatchi et al., 2011; Baccini et al., 2012) with local high-quality biomass data into an improved pan-tropical aboveground biomass map of woody vegetation at 1 km resolution for the 2000’s.<br>\n",

    "The method and results are described in Avitabile et al. (2016). \n",
