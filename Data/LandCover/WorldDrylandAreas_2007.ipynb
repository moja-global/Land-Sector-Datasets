    "## Title: World Dryland Dataset 2007\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "World dryland areas according to UNCCD and CBD definitions. The original drylands dataset was developed to define the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) dryland system boundary. Sörensen (2007) used this map to further delineate dryland areas of relevance to the CBD Programme of Work on Dry and Subhumid Lands. This current dataset builds on these maps to incorporate additional features to update the data to better reflect dry and sub- humid tropical forests in accordance with paragraph 13 of Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) CoP Decision IX/17.<br>\n",
    "The original dataset developed by the MA is a subset of the aridity zone map created by CRU/UEA, UNEP/GRID for the World Atlas of Desertification. Aridity zones were derived from an Aridity Index (AI) which is calculated as the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration. Zones included in this dataset are: hyperarid, arid, semiarid, and dry subhumid. These are in accordance with the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) definition of Drylands.\n",

    "This dataset was updated in 2014 to fix topological errors.\n",

    "UNEP-WCMC, 2007 A spatial analysis approach to the global delineation of dryland areas of relevance to the CBD Programme of Work on Dry and Subhumid Lands. Dataset based on spatial analysis between WWF terrestrial ecoregions (WWF-US, 2004) and aridity zones (CRU/UEA; UNEPGRID, 1991). Dataset checked and refined to remove many gaps, overlaps and slivers (July 2014).\n",
