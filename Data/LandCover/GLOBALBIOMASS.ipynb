    "The data products consist of global datasets including estimates of<br>\n",

    "Definition: volume of all living trees more than 10 cm in diameter at breast height measured over bark from ground or stump height to a top stem diameter of 0 cm. Excludes: smaller branches, twigs, foliage, flowers, seeds, stump and roots (definition of FAO).<br>\n",
