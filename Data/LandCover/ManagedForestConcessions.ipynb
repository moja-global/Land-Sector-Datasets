    "## Title: Managed Forest Concessions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "Displays boundaries of forested areas allocated by governments to companies for harvesting timber and other wood products. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging concession refers to an area allocated by a government for logging in a public forest. Logging concessions are distinct from wood fiber concessions, where plantation forests are established for the production of pulp and paper products. Concession is used as a general term for licenses, permits, or other contracts that confer rights to private companies to manage and extract timber from public forests; terminology varies at the national level, however, and includes \"forest permits,\" \"tenures,\" \"licenses,\" and other terms. The logging concession data on GFW, while displayed as a single layer, is assembled on a country-by-country basis from multiple sources. Logging concession data displayed on the GFW website vary from country to country by date and data sources. Data may come from government agencies, NGOs, or other organizations. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set displays managed forest concessions as a single layer assembled by aggregating data for multiple countries. The data may come from government agencies, NGOs, or other organizations and varies by date and data sources. For more information on concession data for each country please visit the Global Forest Watch Open Data Portal [link](https://data.globalforestwatch.org/datasets/managed-forest-concessions-1).\n",

    "### Notes\n",
    "This layer is a compilation of concession data from various countries and sources. The quality of these data can vary depending on the source. This layer may not be comprehensive of all existing concessions in a country, and the location of certain concessions can be inaccurate. There is some topological error that requires fixing. Indonesia and Malaysia looks to have fairly accurate alignment with the coastline, whereas Canada does not. There are a lot of fully overlapping polygons in Canada (rectified by remove 'pulpwood agreement' PAG series polygons), as well as some strange coastline anomolies, forests in lakes and on small islands. Manual inspection and clean up of the data is recommended if high resolution locally based simulations are intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing\n",
    "See below for arcpy code to fix geometry, gaps and overlaps and convert to JSON. Individual country data have also been separated out and are available in the data library."
