    "## Title: Intact Forest Landscapes (2016)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "The Intact Forest Landscapes (IFL) data set identifies unbroken expanses of natural ecosystems within the zone of forest extent that show no signs of significant human activity and are large enough that all native biodiversity, including viable populations of wide-ranging species, could be maintained. To map IFL areas, a set of criteria was developed and designed to be globally applicable and easily replicable, the latter to allow for repeated assessments over time as well as verification. IFL areas were defined as unfragmented landscapes, at least 50,000 hectares in size, and with a minimum width of 10 kilometers. These were then mapped from Landsat satellite imagery for the year 2000.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes in the extent of IFLs were identified from 2000-2013 and from 2013-2016 within the original year 2000 IFL boundary using the global wall-to-wall Landsat image composite for years 2013, 2016, and the global forest cover loss dataset (Hansen et al., 2013). Areas identified as “reduction in extent” met the IFL criteria in 2000, but no longer met the criteria in 2016. The main causes of change were clearing for agriculture and tree plantations, industrial activity such as logging and mining, fragmentation due to infrastructure and new roads, and fires assumed to be caused by humans.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This data can be used to assess forest intactness, alteration, and degradation at global and regional scales.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The world's IFL map is a spatial database (scale 1:1,000,000) that shows the extent of the intact forest landscapes (IFL) for years 2000, 2013, and 2016.\n",

    "### Notes\n",
    "There is some distortion over southern South Ameria where boundaries do not align with coastline. Seems to be fine elsewhere (Japan, Europe, North America, Tasmania, Australia) so is probably a localised error in the original data.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometry includes non-simple geometry and duplicate vertices that requires repair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets \"ifl_2000\" and \"ifl_2016\" have overlaps. And all datasets have valid gaps and non-valid gaps for repair.\n",
    "\n",
    "File sizes are large due to detail and resultion of the vectors. Gaps and overlaps are evident and can be fixed with code below. Processing time is lengthy. Please note, only gaps smaller than 0.5ha will be fixed as gaps larger than this could be valid. Gaps smaller than 0.5ha could also be valid but are removed in this instance for improved drawing speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing\n",
    "Repair geometry, fix topologial error (remove overlaps and gaps smaller than 0.5ha), convert to geojson, EPSG:4326 (WGS84), remove/disable Z values. View code below - originally processed in ArcGIS but can be converted to open source QGIS or GDAL (or others)."
