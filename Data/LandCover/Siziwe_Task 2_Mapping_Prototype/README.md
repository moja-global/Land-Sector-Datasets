# 🌍 Biodiversity Hotspots Mapping to SDGs Prototype 🌿

## Introduction
Welcome to the Biodiversity Hotspots Mapping Prototype! This project demonstrates how to map and analyze biodiversity hotspots in South Africa to align them with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

## 📂 Project Structure
- `code/`: Python code for geospatial visualization.
- `data/`: Sample data (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_mfGM-9gE6p10vPwePnjRNBgp8ysA0dy/view?usp=sharing).
- `README.md`: You are here!

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries (GeoPandas, Matplotlib) installed.
3. Replace the sample data in the `data/` folder with your dataset.

## 🔍 Prototype Sections
- `Mapping to SDGs`: How we align hotspot attributes with SDGs.
- `Python Code for Visualization`: Geospatial visualization using Python.
- `Conservation Impact`: Learn about the importance of preserving these hotspots.

## 🌿 Conservation Matters
Preserving biodiversity is essential for a sustainable future! 🌱
