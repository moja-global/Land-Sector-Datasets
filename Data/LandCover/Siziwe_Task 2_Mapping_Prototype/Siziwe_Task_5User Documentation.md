### Task 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Description**: The Land sector dataset repository brings together datasets useful for land sector management. Your task is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a specific location of your choice.

- 🌐 **Select a Location**: Choose a country, region, province, state, or city (preferably your local environment).

- 📂 **Navigate Data Library**: Access the data library to find relevant data corresponding to your selected area.

- 📊 **Data Analysis**: Create a Jupyter Notebook in your repository and conduct data analysis on the data you found. Use graphs, plots, dataframes, etc., to provide visualizations and interpretations of the data.

- 📝 **Commit and Share**: Sign off commits, push your work, raise a pull request, and share the link in the #outreachy channel of the Slack community.

### Task 2 - Attribute-SDG Mapping Prototype

🚀 **Description**: In this task, you will work with the Land sector repository to map specific attributes from a chosen dataset to relevant Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

- 📦 **Fork and Clone**: Fork and clone the Land sector repository to your computer.

- 📂 **Select Dataset**: Navigate the data library and select a dataset of your choice. Associate the dataset with its metafile in the cloned repository.

- 🎯 **SDG Mapping**: Choose two relevant SDGs identified in the research task. Develop a prototype for mapping specific attributes from the dataset to these SDGs.

- 📝 **Commit and Share**: Sign off commits, push your work, raise a pull request, and share the link in the #outreachy channel of the Slack community. Exclude the data file from the commit.

### Task 3 - Geospatial Analysis

🚀 **Description**: If the dataset contains spatial information, perform geospatial analysis to identify patterns or trends.

- 🗺️ **Geospatial Analysis**: Use GeoPandas and other geospatial libraries in Python to perform geospatial analysis. Provide visualizations (maps) and a brief report on any spatial patterns or correlations discovered.

- 📝 **Commit and Share**: Sign off commits, push your work, raise a pull request, and share the link in the #outreachy channel of the Slack community. Exclude the data file from the commit.

### Task 4 - Visualization Prototype

🚀 **Description**: Develop a prototype for the data visualization component. Create visualizations that represent the mapped relationships between land attributes and SDGs.

- 📊 **Create Visualizations**: Develop Python code for creating visualizations that illustrate the relationships between land attributes and SDGs.

- 📝 **Commit and Share**: Sign off commits, push your work, raise a pull request, and share the link in the #outreachy channel of the Slack community. Exclude the data file from the commit.

### Task 5 - User Documentation

🚀 **Description**: Begin drafting user documentation to help users understand how to interpret integrated data and use the visualization tool.

- 📄 **User Documentation**: Draft user documentation focusing on the basics of interpreting the integrated data and using the visualization tool.

- 📝 **Commit and Share**: Sign off commits, push your work, raise a pull request, and share the link in the #outreachy channel of the Slack community.


### Creating a Pull Request

🛠️ **How to Create a Pull Request:**

1. Fork the project repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local computer.
3. Create a new branch for your work: `git checkout -b your-branch-name`.
4. Make your changes and commit them using `git commit -s -m "your commit message"`.
5. Push your changes to your GitHub repository: `git push origin your-branch-name`.
6. Visit the original project repository on GitHub and open a new pull request.
7. Review the changes, provide a descriptive title and comment, and create the pull request.

### The Importance of Using `git commit -s -m`

🔑 **Using `git commit -s -m`**:

- The `-s` option sign-off flag indicates that you agree to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO).
- The `-m` option allows you to provide a meaningful commit message that describes your changes.
- It helps maintain clear and well-documented commit history, making it easier for collaborators to understand your contributions.

### Resources Used

📚 **Resources for the Project**:

- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): A Python library for creating data visualizations.
- [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/): A library for geospatial data analysis in Python.

🔧 **How to Get and Use These Resources**:

- Install Python: If not already installed, download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- Install Matplotlib: Run `pip install matplotlib` to install Matplotlib.
- Install GeoPandas: Use `pip install geopandas` to install GeoPandas.
