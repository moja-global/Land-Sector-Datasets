### Task 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🚀 **Description**: The Land sector dataset repository brings together datasets useful for land sector management. Your task is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a specific location of your choice.

- 🌐 **Select a Location**: Choose a country, region, province, state, or city (preferably your local environment).

- 📂 **Navigate Data Library**: Access the data library to find relevant data corresponding to your selected area.

- 📊 **Data Analysis**: Create a Jupyter Notebook in your repository and conduct data analysis on the data you found. Use graphs, plots, dataframes, etc., to provide visualizations and interpretations of the data.

- 📝 **Commit and Share**: Sign off commits, push your work, raise a pull request, and share the link in the #outreachy channel of the Slack community.

### Task 2 - Attribute-SDG Mapping Prototype

🚀 **Description**: In this task, you will work with the Land sector repository to map specific attributes from a chosen dataset to relevant Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

- 📦 **Fork and Clone**: Fork and clone the Land sector repository to your computer.

- 📂 **Select Dataset**: Navigate the data library and select a dataset of your choice. Associate the dataset with its metafile in the cloned repository.

- 🎯 **SDG Mapping**: Choose two relevant SDGs identified in the research task. Develop a prototype for mapping specific attributes from the dataset to these SDGs.

- 📝 **Commit and Share**: Sign off commits, push your work, raise a pull request, and share the link in the #outreachy channel of the Slack community. Exclude the data file from the commit.

### Task 3 - Geospatial Analysis

🚀 **Description**: If the dataset contains spatial information, perform geospatial analysis to identify patterns or trends.

- 🗺️ **Geospatial Analysis**: Use GeoPandas and other geospatial libraries in Python to perform geospatial analysis. Provide visualizations (maps) and a brief report on any spatial patterns or correlations discovered.

- 📝 **Commit and Share**: Sign off commits, push your work, raise a pull request, and share the link in the #outreachy channel of the Slack community. Exclude the data file from the commit.

### Task 4 - Visualization Prototype

🚀 **Description**: Develop a prototype for the data visualization component. Create visualizations that represent the mapped relationships between land attributes and SDGs.

- 📊 **Create Visualizations**: Develop Python code for creating visualizations that illustrate the relationships between land attributes and SDGs.

- 📝 **Commit and Share**: Sign off commits, push your work, raise a pull request, and share the link in the #outreachy channel of the Slack community. Exclude the data file from the commit.

### Task 5 - User Documentation

🚀 **Description**: Begin drafting user documentation to help users understand how to interpret integrated data and use the visualization tool.

- 📄 **User Documentation**: Draft user documentation focusing on the basics of interpreting the integrated data and using the visualization tool.

- 📝 **Commit and Share**: Sign off commits, push your work, raise a pull request, and share the link in the #outreachy channel of the Slack community.
