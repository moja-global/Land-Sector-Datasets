    "## Title: Global Critical Habitat Screening Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "This screening layer shows the global spatial distribution of likely or potential Critical Habitat, as defined by the International Finance Corporation’s Performance Standard 6 (IFC PS6) criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "The composite Critical Habitat layer draws on 20 global-scale datasets, of which 12 datasets support screening of Critical Habitat in the terrestrial realm and 15 datasets support screening in the marine realm. Datasets were disaggregated into subsets if the underlying attributes aligned with different Critical Habitat criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original raster layer attributes each grid cell (1×1 km) as likely or potential Critical Habitat, or unclassified based on a classification scheme reflecting biodiversity data layer alignment with IFC-PS6 Critical Habitat criteria/scenarios and inherent degree of certainty (in terms of presence on the ground).\n",
    "\n",
    "For further information on underlying trigger features behind a likely or potential Critical Habitat value for each cell within the composite data layer please contact business-support@unep-wcmc.org.\n",

    "### Notes\n",
    "Data gaps may occur in terms of completeness and representativeness of underlying datasets. All datasets are subject to errors of commission (stating a feature occurs when it does not) and errors of omission (stating a feature does not occur when it does). Areas classified as likely or potential Critical Habitat therefore require on-ground validation to confirm screening results and unambiguously determine the presence  or absence of Critical Habitat. Similarly, unclassified areas may include locations for which there are no data available to indicate Critical Habitat, and locations which are not Critical Habitat based on the lower biodiversity values located in that area.\n",
