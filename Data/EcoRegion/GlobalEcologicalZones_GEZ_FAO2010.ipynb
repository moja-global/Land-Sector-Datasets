    "## Title: Global Ecological Zones (second edition) FAO 2010\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "The Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) presents global and regional forest data by global ecological zone (GEZ). The GEZ spatial dataset used by FAO has developed over the years from covering only the tropical areas (1990) to the globe (2000). Due to the developments in remote sensing and the compiling of many spatial products relating to climate and land cover between 2000 and 2010, an update to the map was commissioned and resulted in the available GEZ 2010 product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main uses of the map include: a) reporting purposes, to provide baseline forest statistics by ecological zone; b) analysis and modelling purposes, i.e. assessment of forest-based biological diversity, both at ecosystem and species level, and biomass modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### FLINT\n",
    "This dataset has been pre-processed/checked and is suitable for use in FLINT. Please adhere to individual dataset licence conditions and citations. Processed data can be accessed here: https://datasets.mojaglobal.workers.dev/\n",

    "GEZ mapping is coarse grained in some instances, with coastline and islands often cut from mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing\n",
    "Repair geometry, fix topologial error (remove overlaps), convert to geojson, EPSG:4326 (WGS84), remove/disable Z values. View code below - originally processed in ArcGIS but can be converted to open source QGIS or GDAL (or others)."
