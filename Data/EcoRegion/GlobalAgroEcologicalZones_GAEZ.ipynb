    "## Title: GAEZ Global Agro‐Ecological Zones (GAEZ v3.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "The term GAEZ refers to the Agro-Ecological Zones system, developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in collaboration with the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). The approach enables rational land-use planning on the basis of an inventory of land resources and an evaluation of their biophysical limitations and potentials for crop production. The GAEZ programs utilize the land resources inventory to assess all feasible agricultural land-use options and to quantify expected production of cropping activities relevant in a particular agro-ecological context, for specified management conditions and levels of inputs. The characterization of land resources includes all relevant components of climate, soils and landform, which are basic for the supply of water, energy, nutrients and physical support to plants.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "GAEZ provides a standardized framework for the characterization of climate, soil and terrain conditions relevant to agricultural production. It identifies crop-specific limitations of climate, soil and terrain resources in a consistent and empirically founded way. It systematically computes spatial and temporal data on maximum potential and attainable crop yields as well as expected sustainable agricultural production potentials at different specified levels of inputs and management conditions. The GAEZ computations were completed for a range of climatic conditions, including a reference climate (average of period 1961-1990), individual historical years of 1901 to 2009 (climate data for individual years for the period 1960-2000 are uploaded in GAEZ v3.0 Data Portal) and future climate based on the published outputs of various global and regional climate models combined with IPCC scenarios. Hence, the GAEZ results consistently quantify impacts on land productivity of historical climate variability as well as of potential future climate change.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The [GAEZ portal](https://webarchive.iiasa.ac.at/Research/LUC/GAEZv3.0/) contains many different datasets and timelines (soil, climate, crop yields, themral regimes, land resources and protected areas) that can be downloaded (one by one) for use in FLINT (includes historic, baseline and future climate scenarios). Only a subset of what is available have been preprocessed for FLINT here but please use the below code to convert any GAEZ portal dataset to FLINT ready format, specifying desired cell size.<br>\n",

    "Climate and agro-climatic data analyses are performed for: (i) individual historical years (1961-2000); (ii) average climatic conditions of a baseline period (1961-1990), and (iii) future climatic conditions (2020s, 2050s and 2080s -  future periods require selection of global circulation model/emission scenario combination and, where applicable, CO2 fertilization effect has to be switched ON or OFF). In addition, (iv) selected average results (and variability) are generated on the basis of climatic and agro-climatic analysis of individual historical years. And the 30-year average results (and variability) based on climate and agro-climatic analysis of historical years for the period 1961-1990.<br>\n",

    "### Notes\n",
    "Datasets are a combo of float and integer types with varying value ranges. Ascii raster cell resolution 0.0833 needs to be rounded to nearest multiple of a degree. Extents need to be expanded to full global coverage to allow for FLINT appropriate cell alignment (origin -180, -90, 180, 90). The GAEZ portal contains many different datasets and timelines (soil, climate, crop yields, themral regimes, land resources, population and protected areas) that can be downloaded for use in FLINT. Only a subset of what is available have been preprocessed. Use the below code to convert any GAEZ portal dataset to FLINT ready format, specifying desired cell size.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the GAEZv3 portal is a bit buggy and will not allow download of all datasets.\n",
