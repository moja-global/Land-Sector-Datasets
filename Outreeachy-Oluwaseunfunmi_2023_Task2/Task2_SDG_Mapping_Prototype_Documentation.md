# SDG MAPPING PROTOTYPE
**OVERVIEW**
hThe SDG Mapping Prototyps is a tool developed to map specific attributes from avarious Land Sector  dataset to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It provides a systematic way to determine howhese e attributes align with various SDGs, facilitating data-driven insights and decision-makin
Each section provides specific dataset used, understanding the nature and attributes of the data,  and their relevance to sustainability and development goals, identify the relevant SDG, Analyze and visualize the datasets.

In this task, the area of specialization is Nigeria (NGA) and datasets considered are Soil resouces, Climate zones and Geoecological zones
#
# NGA Soil Resouces
**SDG 2: ZERO HUNGER**
    *Dataset Attribute*
    IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) : contains the soil types available in Nigeria which pertains to their relevance to climate change or environmental factors.
**SDG 15: LIFE ON LAND**
    *Dataset ATtribute* : IPCC

**Mapping Explanation**
Two SDGs are mapped for this task with respect to the soil types present in Nigeria. Each soil types align more with specific sustainable goals and are mapped accordingly.

**Mapping Result**
Acrisol is mapped to SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) because they are often used for agriculture, and sustainable agriculture is relevant to SDG 2.

Arenosol is mapped to SDG 15 (Life on Land): they can be related to desertification issues, which are relevant to SDG 15.

Fluvisol is mapped to SDG 15 (Life on Land) bacuserelate to river and floodplain soils, which are important for land management and conservation.

Gleysol and its Alignment with SDG 15 (Life on Land): they are associated with wetlands, which are important ecosystems for land conservation.

Lixisol and its Alignment with SDG 15 (Life on Land): they may be found in tropical regions and relate to land use and conservation.


Vertisol and its Alignment with SDG 15 (Life on Land): they are often found in dry regions and may be linked to land management and conservation.

#  NGA CLimate Zones
**SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation**
     *Dataset Attribute*: CLASS_NAME

**Mapping Explanation**
From the metadata file, the mapped climate zones are: Warm temperate moist, Warm temperate dry, Cool temperate moist, Cool temperate dry, Polar moist, Polar dry, Boreal moist, Boreal dry, Tropical montane. It is represented with values 1-9 respectively. This is used to mapped two sustainable goals that most align. Other values present in Nigeria climate zone file were not mapped.

**Mapping Result**
Tropical Montane (9): This refers to mountainous regions within the tropics, which can have unique climate characteristics due to elevation This climate type could be relevant to SDGs related to clean water and sanitation (SDG 6) and life on land (SDG 15) due to their unique ecosystems and potential effects on water resources.

# NGA GeoEcological Zones
**SDG 15: Life on Land**
**SDG 14: Life below Water**
     *Dataset Attribute*: gez_name
     
**Mapping Explanation**
'gez_name' column contains different geoecological zones present in Nigeria. The most two suitable sustainable goals are mapped to the available GeoEcological zones in Nigeria

**Mapping Result**
Tropical Dry Forest, Tropical Moist Forest, Tropical Mountain System, Tropical Rainforest, Tropical Shrubland, are all present in Nigeria and they all with SDG 15 (Life on Land)

Aslo Waterbody is present and it aligns with SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and SDG 14 (Life below Water) but SDG 14 is mapped
