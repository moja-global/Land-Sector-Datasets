Much of the focus of existing guidance on applying spatial data in carbon accounting models has been on either how to use existing data sources or guidance for analysts on the processing of spatial data. 
As both the number and nature of potential providers of spatial data evolves, the issue of interest is no longer limited to how to use existing data and now includes how to procure data. Sources of data are no longer limited to a small range of providers and off-the-shelf products and now includes the scope to purchase data products to needed technical specifications from commercial providers. 
This paper provides guidance on requirements for ‘approach to market’ specifications for engaging with data providers (commercial or otherwise) to obtain fit-for-purpose data. The aim is to educate FLINT implementers on important requirements for spatially explicit data and avoid some of the potential pitfalls encountered in data procurement.
A checklist is presented to assist procurers determine the content of technical requirements for approaches to market. A particular focus is given to remotely sensed data for land representation (forest cover loss and gain) as methods for ground measurements, though variable in application, are a more routine practice.
