### Moja Global's Land Sector Dataset Description

In most files, there is a field called **geometry**. These fields represent vector geometry and are used to represent the spatial components of geographic features with discrete boundaries.
#### DECLARATION: Any field already described in a current section is ignored in the subsequent sections to avoid field description redundancy.

The Land Sector Dataset is divided into five main categories; which are:

1. [Administrative](https://datasets.mojaglobal.workers.dev/0:/Administrative/)
2. [Biodiveersity, AgroClimatic and Ecological Zones](https://datasets.mojaglobal.workers.dev/0:/Bioclimatic&EcologicalZones/)
3. [Climate](https://datasets.mojaglobal.workers.dev/0:/Climate/)
4. [Land Cover](https://datasets.mojaglobal.workers.dev/0:/LandCover/)
5. [Soil](https://datasets.mojaglobal.workers.dev/0:/Soil/)



# 1. ADMINISRTATIVE
The administrative directory has three subdirectories as explained below.


### 1.1   Bounderies

> In this directory, there are files containing Political boundaries which are the dividing lines between countries, states, provinces, counties, and cities. These lines, more often called borders, are created by people to separate areas governed by different groups. Sometimes, political boundaries follow  boundaries, but most of the time you can't see them.



> The bounderies are in two levels. 

##### 1.1.1 The directories with Level 2 contain bounderies at the country level including the Global Ecological Zone bounderies for each country as well as the World Soil Resourcess' boundaries; 
>* The general notation of files is : **COUNTRY_AL4_country.json**( implying the country code followed by Administrative Level 2, followed by the country name).
The files are made up of twelve (12) important fields: as explained below:
>1. **country:** refers to the name of the country
>2. **ISO3166_2:** (ISO standard codes of administrative divisions and subdivisions) In other words - Administrative Divisions of Countries
