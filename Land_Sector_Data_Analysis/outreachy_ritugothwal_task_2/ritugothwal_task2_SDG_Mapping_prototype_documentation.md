# **SDG Mapping Prototype**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) mapping prototypes formulated for diverse land sector datasets. 
Individual sections meticulously delineate the particular dataset employed, scrutinize the attributes examined, elucidate the logic underpinning the mapping, 
and present the results derived from the process.

In this project I majorly focusing on exploring the climate change and environmental degradation of Himalyan region of India.
The region is also home to diverse ecosystems and numerous species of flora and fauna, many of which are endemic and thus of significant conservation value. 
This region is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and environmental degradation.

**Why is the Himalayan Region Vulnerable?**

- The Himalayan region is experiencing a warming rate that is significantly higher than the global average, resulting in glacier retreat, reduced snow cover, and shifts in precipitation patterns.Glacial retreat leads to the formation of glacial lakes, which can potentially result in glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), posing a risk to downstream communities and infrastructure.

- Deforestation, illegal mining, and infrastructure development have led to habitat fragmentation and loss, threatening wildlife and reducing the region's ecological resilience. Overgrazing, unsustainable agricultural practices, and pollution have resulted in soil erosion, land degradation, and water quality issues.

**Why is it Important for Us?**

- Water Security: The rivers originating from the Himalayan glaciers provide water for drinking, agriculture, and industry for millions of people in India and other Asian countries. Any alteration in the flow of these rivers due to climate change or glacial retreat can have severe implications for water security and livelihoods.

- Biodiversity: The region is a biodiversity hotspot, with numerous endemic species and unique ecosystems. Preserving this biodiversity is crucial for maintaining ecological balance, supporting traditional livelihoods, and for potential scientific research and medicinal discoveries.

- Climate Regulation: The Himalayas play a role in influencing the climate of the region by affecting the monsoon patterns. They also act as a barrier, preventing cold winds from the north from reaching the Indian subcontinent, thereby maintaining the climate suitable for agriculture.

- Cultural and Spiritual Significance: The Himalayas have deep cultural, spiritual, and religious significance for many communities in India and neighboring countries.Protecting this cultural heritage is essential for maintaining the social fabric and traditional knowledge systems of the region.

By exploring the following land sector datasets I am trying to develop a few of the sustainable development goal mapping prototypes:

# **1. Biodiversity hotspots**

**SDG 15: Life on Land**

SDG 15, Life on Land, focuses on the protection, restoration, and promotion of sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainable management of forests, combating desertification, and halting and reversing land degradation and biodiversity loss.

When mapping land sector datasets with SDG 15, the area of biodiversity hotspots plays a crucial role in achieving this goal. Biodiversity hotspots are regions with high levels of species richness and endemism, which are under significant threat from human activities. 
Protecting these hotspots is integral to preserving unique ecosystems and the species that inhabit them.

**Dataset Attributes:**
  - The CI Biodiversity Hotspots dataset gives information on area of the protected land and the name of the biodiversity hotspot.

# **2. Ecological Zones**

**SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation)** : Ecological zones such as wetlands play a crucial role in water purification and supply.

**SDG 13 (Climate Action)** : Ecological zones such as forests act as carbon sinks, helping to mitigate climate change.

**SDG 14 (Life Below Water)** : Coastal and marine ecological zones are important for maintaining healthy oceans and marine life.

**SDG 15 (Life on Land)** : This is the most directly related goal. Ecological zones are vital for sustaining terrestrial life, and their conservation is key to protecting biodiversity, combating desertification, and managing forests sustainably.

**Dataset Attributes:**
It is important to know the type and number of diverse ecological zones which are present in the Himalayan region because
understanding the diverse ecological zones in the Himalayan region is crucial for achieving several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
For SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), the region's river systems need to be effectively managed to ensure access to clean water. 
In terms of SDG 13 (Climate Action), the Himalayas significantly influence South Asia's climate, and studying its ecological zones is vital for developing climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. 
Similarly, for SDG 14 (Life Below Water), the conservation of aquatic biodiversity in the rivers originating from the Himalayas is essential. 
The region's rich biodiversity, crucial for SDG 15 (Life on Land), requires understanding of ecological zones to protect habitats and manage natural resources sustainably. 


# **3. Holdridges Life Zones**

Holdridges Life Zones also covers the same SDGs as mentioned in the ecological zones. 

**SDG 15 (Life on Land)**: Holdridge's Life Zones provide valuable information on different terrestrial ecosystems and their characteristics. This information is crucial for the conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, including forests, wetlands, mountains, and drylands, as outlined in SDG 15.

**SDG 13 (Climate Action)**: The classification helps understand the potential impacts of climate change on different ecosystems, thus contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.

**SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation)**: By helping to understand the ecosystems around water bodies, the datasets can contribute to the management and conservation of freshwater resources.

**SDG 14 (Life Below Water)**: Although primarily focused on terrestrial environments, the zones can indirectly contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas, and marine resources by providing data on coastal and estuarine ecosystems.

**Dataset Attributes:**
Information on the type and area of Holdridge life zones in the Himalayan region is vital for biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation and adaptation, freshwater resource management, and sustainable use of marine resources, which are all key aspects 
of the mentioned SDGs.

# **4. Agroecological Zones**

**SDG 2 (Zero Hunger)**: Agroecological zones help identify suitable areas for different types of crops and livestock, contributing to increased food production and improved food security.

**SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation)**: These datasets can assist in the management of water resources for agriculture, ensuring efficient use of water and reducing water pollution.

**SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production)**: Agroecological zones provide information necessary for sustainable agriculture practices that minimize environmental impacts and promote efficient use of resources.

**SDG 13 (Climate Action)**: The datasets can be used to analyze the impacts of climate change on agriculture and develop adaptation strategies for farmers.

**SDG 15 (Life on Land)**: Agroecological zones can play a role in conserving ecosystems and biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, as well as in the restoration of degraded lands.

**Dataset Attributes:**
Maps of agroecological zones provide valuable information for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by delineating regions based on their agricultural potential and ecological characteristics. 
These maps can help identify suitable areas for different types of crops and livestock, contributing to food security (SDG 2). They also support sustainable agriculture practices that minimize environmental impacts and promote efficient use of resources (SDG 12). 
Additionally, such maps are essential for water resource management in agriculture, ensuring clean water availability (SDG 6). Furthermore, agroecological zones can be used to assess the impacts of climate change on agriculture and develop adaptation strategies for farmers (SDG 13),
while also playing a role in conserving ecosystems and biodiversity in agricultural landscapes and restoring degraded lands (SDG 15). In summary, maps of agroecological zones are crucial tools for informed decision-making in agriculture, contributing to food security, sustainable resource use, and environmental conservation.


# **5. Climate Zones**

The data on climate zones, therefore, plays a crucial role in achieving multiple SDGs by providing crucial information for decision-making in climate action, biodiversity conservation, sustainable agriculture, water management, urban planning, and public health.

**Dataset Attributes:**
A map of climate zones can serve as a vital tool for mapping and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by providing essential data to inform decision-making across various sectors. 
For instance, climate zone maps can inform strategies for climate action (SDG 13) by identifying regions that are most vulnerable to climate change and require targeted mitigation and adaptation measures. 
In terms of life on land (SDG 15), climate zone maps can help identify key biodiversity areas and their specific climate conditions, facilitating targeted conservation efforts. 
Moreover, these maps can support sustainable agriculture practices (SDG 2) by identifying suitable regions for different crops and farming methods, based on their climate conditions, thereby contributing to food security. 
Additionally, climate zone maps can guide water management practices (SDG 6) by indicating regions that may experience water scarcity or flooding due to climate variability, enabling the implementation of appropriate water conservation or infrastructure measures. 
In urban planning (SDG 11), climate zone maps can be used to design infrastructure that is resilient to local climate impacts, ultimately contributing to the development of sustainable cities and communities. 
Overall, mapping climate zones in relation to the SDGs can provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges and opportunities associated with each goal, facilitating more informed and effective interventions.
