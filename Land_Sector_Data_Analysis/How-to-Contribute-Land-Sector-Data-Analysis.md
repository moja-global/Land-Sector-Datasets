# Moja Global Land Sector Data Analysis Guide

## 1.0 Introduction

This document aims to guide contributors to report the analysis of [Moja Global's Land Sector Dataset.](https://datasets.mojaglobal.workers.dev/0:/). 

---

### 1.0.0 The Land Sector Dataset
The dataset is a collection of publicly available [Open source datasets](https://github.com/moja-global/Land_Sector_Datasets) which you can choose any and work on. 

- Many countries use the dataset and work well in real globe scenarios. For each data set, information about content and licenses are provided. Proper permissions have been cited for all the datasets, and we urge you to follow the license for every dataset before proceeding to work with it.

If you have another dataset on your mind that would be beneficial to [Moja Global's mission](https://moja.global/), please feel free to reach out to us on [info@moja.global](info@moja.global) to share details about this dataset.

---

### 1.0.1 Data Analysis Software and Notebooks

Notebooks are documents produced by the data analysis software, which contain both computer code (e.g. python) and rich text elements (paragraph, equations, figures, links, etcâ€¦). 
>Notebook documents are both human-readable documents containing the analysis description and executable code which can be run to perform data analysis. 

Select software that supports geospatial analysis. 
- Moja Global is an open-source project, and the interest here is to share your process (code) and results (explanation) to support the open-source movement. In order to effectively record your analysis, we recommend that you use a [notebook.](https://sourceforge.net/software/product/Google-Colab/alternatives).

### 1.0.2 Contributing

When your contribution is ready; raise a PR to have it merged. Please refer to the [community website](https://community.moja.global/community/code-contribution) to know how to make a pull request.

>If you have experience and want to help, please send an email to [mentorship@moja.global](mailto:mentorship@moja.global). We are open to mentoring new developers and contributors through various mentorship program and initiatives.

### 1.0.3 The Analysis

When we look at climate action, we would like to get descriptions from a global scale to a specific state administration within a particular country. A draft review of the characteristics of each file in the dataset is found [here](https://github.com/Simpleshell3/Land-Sector-Dataset-Description/blob/main/Land-Sector-Dataset-Description.md).

Amongst the numerous factors that affecct climate change, the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector is responsible for almost a quarter of the global Greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. The emissions associated with AFOLU activities are projected to increase in the future.


The following sections of this guide will direct you on how to document your analysis at any scale(global, continental, country, state).
