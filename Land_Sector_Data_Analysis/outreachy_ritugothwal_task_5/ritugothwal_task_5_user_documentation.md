## Task 0: Git & GitHub Basics

### 🎯Objective:

The primary objective of this task is to familiarize contributors with the essential role of Git and GitHub in open-source projects, specifically in terms of maintaining transparency, collaboration, and accessibility. Additionally, it aims to guide contributors in setting up their GitHub account and repository for project collaboration.

### 🛠️Steps:

1. **Create a GitHub Account:** If you don’t have a GitHub account, create one by visiting the GitHub website and following the sign-up instructions.

2. **Create a Repository:** Add a new repository named `Outreachy_username_2022` where `username` is your Slack handle on the moja global Slack community.

3. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the newly created repository to your local computer using Git. This step will facilitate your work as you can pull and push changes directly from and to GitHub.

4. **Use a Code Editor:** Consider using a versatile code editor like Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to enhance your development experience.

## Task 1: Land Sector Management and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

###  🎯Objective:
The objective of this task is to perform an in-depth analysis of land sector data to derive valuable insights that can guide land sector management efforts.

### 🛠️Steps:
1. **Select Geographic Area:** Choose a specific geographical area such as a country, region, province, state, or city, preferably your local environment.

2. **Navigate to Data Library:** Explore the data library hosted on moja global's Google Drive and identify all relevant data types corresponding to your selected area.

3.  **Perform Data Analysis:** Create a Jupyter notebook in your repository and conduct a comprehensive data analysis using various visualization tools like graphs, plots, and dataframes to interpret the data.

4. **Share Work:** Sign off your commits, push the changes to your repository, raise a pull request, and share the link to your work in the `#outreachy` channel on the moja global Slack community.

## Task 2: Attribute-SDG Mapping Prototype

###  🎯Objective:
This task aims to develop a prototype that clearly maps specific dataset attributes to relevant Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) identified in the research.

### 🛠️Steps:
1. **Fork & Clone Repository:** Fork and clone the Land sector repository to your local computer.

2. **Select Dataset & Metafile:** Navigate to the data library, select a dataset of your choice, and associate it with its corresponding metafile in the cloned repo.

3. **Identify SDGs:** Choose two relevant SDGs for your dataset and develop a prototype that maps specific attributes of the dataset to these SDGs.

4. **Share Work:** Sign off your commits, push the changes to your repository, raise a pull request, and share the link to your work in the `#outreachy` channel on Slack.

## Task 3: Geospatial Analysis

###  🎯Objective:
The main objective of this task is to perform comprehensive geospatial analysis to uncover significant patterns or trends in spatial data.

### 🛠️Steps:
1. **Check for Spatial Information:** Ensure your dataset contains spatial information.

2. **Utilize GeoPandas & Other Libraries:** Use GeoPandas along with other Python geospatial libraries to analyze the spatial data.

3. **Provide Visualizations & Report:** Generate visualizations such as maps to represent the data, and draft a brief report detailing any identified spatial patterns or correlations.

4. **Share Work:** Sign off your commits, push the changes to your repository, raise a pull request, and share the link to your work in the `#outreachy` channel on Slack.

## Task 4: Visualization Prototype

###  🎯Objective:
This task focuses on developing a prototype for data visualization, which will effectively represent the relationships between land attributes and SDGs.

### 🛠️Steps:


1. **Develop Visualizations:** Create meaningful visualizations that effectively represent the mapped relationships between land attributes and SDGs.

2. **Share Python Code:** Ensure to make the Python code used for creating the prototype visualizations available.

3. **Share Work:** Sign off your commits, push the changes to your repository, raise a pull request, and share the link to your work in the `#outreachy` channel on Slack.

By diligently following these steps and adhering to the objectives outlined for each task, contributors can gain valuable insights from integrated data and utilize the visualization tool to significantly enhance the understanding and management of land sectors.

## Task 5: User Documentation

###  🎯Objective:
This task involves drafting user documentation to assist users in interpreting integrated data and utilizing the visualization tool effectively.

### 🛠️Steps:

1. **User Documentation:** Draft comprehensive user documentation that focuses on the basics of interpreting integrated data and using the visualization tool.

2. **Commit and Share:** Once your documentation is ready, sign off your commits and push your work to the repository. Raise a pull request and share the link in the #outreachy channel of our Slack community.
